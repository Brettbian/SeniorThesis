Although deep learning is extending the frontier of data science with rapidly emerging applications, it is often hard to explain and interpret the neural networks. Recent works have shown that with continuous time idealization, residual neural networks can be viewed as a mean field optimal control problem. This thesis extends the theoretical formulation to generative adversarial network composed by two residual neural networks and explores the game between the generator and the discriminator. Additionally, with experiments on different distributions, we visualize the dynamical process and provide insights into the effect of each layer.
