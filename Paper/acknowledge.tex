I would like to express my deep and sincere gratitude to my research supervisor, Professor Mathieu Lauri√®re for giving me the opportunity to do research and providing invaluable guidance throughout this research. He is knowledgeable, enthusiastic and patient. He encouraged me when I was overwhelmed by the content and felt frustrated. Even with a 12 hour time difference between New York and Shanghai and such difficult lockdown situation, he always provided me with immediate, constructive and detailed help. It was my honor to carry out this research under his supervision and I am grateful that he gradually introduced me to such an interesting, integrated, fast-developing field of study.

\noindent I am thankful for all my mathematics professors for preparing me with sufficient and substantial knowledge to understand and research this topic. I would also like to thank my peers Yuchen Zhu, Lexie Zhu for listening to my presentation and giving useful feedback. Discussions with Winston Liang, Travis Luo, Jimmy Zhu, Wenbo Bao were very helpful for me to sort things out and proceed with confidence. 

\noindent I am extremely grateful for my parents for their love, caring, and sacrifices for educating me and preparing me for the future. I really appreciate the emotional support from my friends. Special thanks go to Tony Chen and Evelyn Sheng. This thesis would have not been possible without countless cheer ups from you.
